        What follows is a brief presentation of some of the most important branches of Mathematics
    </p>
    <h2 class="altfont">
        Algebra
    </h2>
    <h3>
        A broad field of mathematics, algebra deals with solving generic algebraic expressions and manipulating them to
        arrive at results.
    </h3>

    <p>
        Unknown quantities denoted by alphabets that form a part of an equation are solved for and the value of the
        variable is determined. A fascinating branch of mathematics, it involves complicated solutions and formulas to
        derive answers to the problems posed.

        Geometry
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Do you often wonder about the shapes and sizes of various objects? Then geometry is the branch you must explore.
    </h3>

    <p>
        Dealing with the shape, sizes, and volumes of figures, geometry is a practical branch of mathematics that
        focuses on the study of polygons, shapes, and geometric objects in both two-dimensions and three-dimensions.
        Congruence of objects is studied at the same time focussing on their special properties and calculation of their
        area, volume, and perimeter. The importance of geometry lies in its actual usage while creating objects in
        practical life.

        Calculus
    </h2>
    <h3>
        It is one of the advanced branches of mathematics and studies the rate of change.
    </h3>

    <p class="underlined">
        With the advent of calculus, a revolutionary change was brought about in the study of maths. Earlier maths could
        only work on static objects but with calculus, mathematical principles began to be applied to objects in motion.
        Used in a multitude of fields, the branch can be further categorized into the differential and integral calculus
        both starkly different from each other. A branch with mind-numbing questions, calculus is an interesting concept
        introduced to students at a later stage of their study in mathematics.

        Probability and Statistics
    </h2>
    <h3>
        The abstract branch of mathematics, probability and statistics use mathematical concepts to predict events that
        are likely to happen and organize, analyze, and interpret a collection of data.
    </h3>

    <p id="special">
        Amongst the relatively newer branches of mathematics, it has become indispensable because of its use in both
        natural and social sciences. The scope of this branch involves studying the laws and principles governing
        numerical data and random events. Presenting an interesting study, statistics, and probability is a branch full
        of surprises.
